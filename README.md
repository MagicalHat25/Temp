# FFXIV UI Setup

## Acquiring TexTools
In order to install any texture related mods into FF14, the program 'TexTools' is utilized. A download can be found for TexTools by clicking the following link (Note, cliking this link will immediately begin a download): https://github.com/esrinzou/FFXIV_TexTools_UI/releases/download/v2.0.12.8/TexToolsPreviewPatch2.0.12.8.zip

Once downloaded, please extract the contents of the .zip folder to a Folder anywhere that you would like it to be. This folder will contain the TexTools .exe file to launch the TexTools program. 

After extraction, please run the `FFXIV_TexTools.exe` file located within the folder. This will prompt you through some brief setup. 

You will be asked to select the location of your FF14 install. Please navigate to wherever you have installed FF14 and select the appropriate .exe file (Choose the DX11 variant if you are using the DX11 client. This setting can be seen within the FF14 launcher.)

After this, TexTools setup will be completed and you will be able to launch the program with the `FFXIV_TexTools.exe` file whenever you like. 

## Acquiring UI Mods 

The UI mods for FF14 are in two parts. 
- Part 1 (Basic UI): https://github.com/skotlex/ffxiv-material-ui/releases/download/3.2.0/Material-UI.v3.2.0.zip
- Part 2 (Additional Elements): https://github.com/skotlex/ffxiv-material-ui/releases/download/3.2.0/OPTIONS.v1.0.0.zip

Please download the above .zip files and extract them to a folder of your liking. Inside each .zip file you will find `.ttmp` and `.ttmp2` files. In the `OPTIONS` zip file, you will find a nested directory of folders. This is done as there are multiple choices you can make, such as a round or square minimap. Use the folder naming to navigate to the choice you prefer (using the provided .png files within the folders as reference) and you will find the `.ttmp` files in the corresponding folders.
